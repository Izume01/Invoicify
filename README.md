## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started (Local Development)

Follow these steps to get your development environment set up:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/invoicify.git
    cd invoicify
    ```
    > **Note**: Make sure to replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username if you've forked the repository.

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    We recommend using `pnpm` for package management.
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project and add the following variables. You'll need a PostgreSQL database URL.
    ```env
    DATABASE_URL="postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE"
    NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-super-secret-nextauth-secret"
    ```
    > **Security Note**: `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` can be any random string. You can generate one using `openssl rand -base64 32` on a Unix-like system.

4.  **Run database migrations:**
    This will set up your database schema.
    ```bash
    pnpm prisma migrate dev --name init
    ```

5.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```
    Your application should now be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
